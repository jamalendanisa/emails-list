This is a report describing my efforts in the process of completing the missions.

It tooks around 14 hours to completed this challenge.
First i build the project using create-react-app then configure it with React Redux.
After that i generate the mockup data using https://mockaroo.com/. Creating the actions, reducers,
sagas. Once the function for fetching data is working i created the table using mui-datatables.

After that, customized the table design and the data so it looks more similar with the design. 
Then created the datepicker using react-dates and clear button so it looks just like the design and with
working functionality. Then i create design for when the data still load and when the data is empty.

It tooks quite some time to find what's best for showing the email's body. I switch the plugin 3 times and finally got what i've been looking for and it meets with the task's requirements too. Change the design a little and after all of it works and looks similar with the design. I move to make the mobile version.

I created the mobile version and I added lazy load but not with serverside processing yet. I just show the outlook just so it looks like the data will load partially when the user scroll the screen. And once it finished, i create a small coverage test for the components using Jest with Enzyme. I'm sorry if it is not fully covered since i want to post this as soon as possible.

Thank you very much for the opportunity. I really hope i could be a succesful candidate and be a part of your team. どうぞよろしくお願いいたします。

Have a nice day.
