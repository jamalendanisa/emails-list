Thank you very much for the opportunity. The challenge took quite a time but it was fun. I'm glad i could completed it with a quite high-fidelity UI and functionality. Hope you would like it and this challenge could bring me to the next step.

So here is my thoughts about the things that could be improved from the current UI.

- I'm quite sure the data could be more than 1000 so it is important to use table who could manage so much data and could handle serverside processing too, so i use a datatable from Material UI called mui-datatables. The pagination is important in the table so it should be there on the UI. And it is convenient to be able to search anything from the data, filtering columns, even print and download data that already being filtered and this datatable could bring the justice for it.

- I add a clear button that would refresh search by date condition so the data would be back like before filtered.

- A provider to access or open the attachment files.

- If this system is for retrieve and verify emails, the major thing that must be there on the UI is the action buttons to retrieve or verify the emails. I didn't add it on this project but I really suggest this button or something similar to trigger the actions is should be there.

- If there is a leakage of sensitive information via emails, i think the report action to give warning or to collect the emails contained the leakage should be added too. With this data, we could have a prevention to such event by giving a warning to the sender so they would not do that again or for a prove or reference that could be used in the future.

- Then, the emails list should be sorted to three categories. So the admin could manage it more easier.
    1. New emails that just sent (still not given any action).
    2. Emails that have been approved or verified.
    3. Emails that have been retrieved or reported.

I think that's all of that for now. Once again thank you very much for the opportunity. I really hope i could be a succesful candidate and be a part of your team.
どうぞよろしくお願いいたします。

Have a nice day.
